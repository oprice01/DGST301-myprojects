## My Bot Project
My twitter bot, hosted on @creativecoding5, tweets a line from Edgar Allan Poe poetry and Shakespeare sonnets together to create a two-line collaborative poem. It tweets twice a day, and the code can be found under bot-code.json. To figure out how many different generated tweets my bot could create, I multiplied the number of lines in the Poe list with the number in the Shakespeare list, and came up with a little over 100,000.
