"shakespeare": ["From fairest creatures we desire increase,",
" That thereby beauty's rose might never die,",
" But as the riper should by time decease,",
" His tender heir might bear his memory:",
" But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,",
" Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,",
" Making a famine where abundance lies,",
" Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:",
" Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,",
" And only herald to the gaudy spring,",
" Within thine own bud buriest thy content,",
" And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:",
"Pity the world, or else this glutton be,",
"To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.",

" When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,",
" And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,",
" Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,",
" Will be a tatter'd weed of small worth held:",
" Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,",
" Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;",
" To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,",
" Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.",
" How much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use,",
" If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine",
" Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,'",
" Proving his beauty by succession thine!",
"This were to be new made when thou art old,",
"And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.",

" Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest",
" Now is the time that face should form another;",
" Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,",
" Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.",
" For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb",
" Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?",
" Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,",
" Of his self-love to stop posterity?",
" Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee",
" Calls back the lovely April of her prime;",
" So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,",
" Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.",
"But if thou live, remember'd not to be,",
"Die single and thine image dies with thee.",

" Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend",
" Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?",
" Nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,",
" And being frank she lends to those are free:",
" Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse",
" The bounteous largess given thee to give?",
" Profitless usurer, why dost thou use",
" So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?",
" For having traffic with thy self alone,",
" Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive:",
" Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,",
" What acceptable audit canst thou leave?",
" Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,",
" Which, used, lives th' executor to be.",

" Those hours, that with gentle work did frame",
" The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,",
" Will play the tyrants to the very same",
" And that unfair which fairly doth excel;",
" For never-resting time leads summer on",
" To hideous winter, and confounds him there;",
" Sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,",
" Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:",
" Then were not summer's distillation left,",
" A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,",
" Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,",
" Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was:",
" But flowers distill'd, though they with winter meet,",
" Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.",

" Then let not winter's ragged hand deface,",
" In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:",
" Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place",
" With beauty's treasure ere it be self-kill'd.",
" That use is not forbidden usury,",
" Which happies those that pay the willing loan;",
" That's for thy self to breed another thee,",
" Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;",
" Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,",
" If ten of thine ten times refigur'd thee:",
" Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,",
" Leaving thee living in posterity?",
" Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair",
" To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.",

" Lo! in the orient when the gracious light",
" Lifts up his burning head, each under eye",
" Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,",
" Serving with looks his sacred majesty;",
" And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,",
" Resembling strong youth in his middle age,",
" Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,",
" Attending on his golden pilgrimage:",
" But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,",
" Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,",
" The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are",
" From his low tract, and look another way:",
" So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon:",
" Unlook'd, on diest unless thou get a son.",

" Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?",
" Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:",
" Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,",
" Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?",
" If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,",
" By unions married, do offend thine ear,",
" They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds",
" In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.",
" Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,",
" Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;",
" Resembling sire and child and happy mother,",
" Who, all in one, one pleasing note do sing:",
" Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,",
" Sings this to thee: 'Thou single wilt prove none.'",

" Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye,",
" That thou consum'st thy self in single life?",
" Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die,",
" The world will wail thee like a makeless wife;",
" The world will be thy widow and still weep",
" That thou no form of thee hast left behind,",
" When every private widow well may keep",
" By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:",
" Look! what an unthrift in the world doth spend",
" Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;",
" But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,",
" And kept unused the user so destroys it.",
" No love toward others in that bosom sits",
" That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.",

" For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,",
" Who for thy self art so unprovident.",
" Grant, if thou wilt, thou art belov'd of many,",
" But that thou none lov'st is most evident:",
" For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate,",
" That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire,",
" Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate",
" Which to repair should be thy chief desire.",
" O! change thy thought, that I may change my mind:",
" Shall hate be fairer lodg'd than gentle love?",
" Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,",
" Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:",
" Make thee another self for love of me,",
" That beauty still may live in thine or thee.",

" As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow'st,",
" In one of thine, from that which thou departest;",
" And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,",
" Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest,",
" Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase;",
" Without this folly, age, and cold decay:",
" If all were minded so, the times should cease",
" And threescore year would make the world away.",
" Let those whom nature hath not made for store,",
" Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:",
" Look, whom she best endow'd, she gave thee more;",
" Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:",
" She carv'd thee for her seal, and meant thereby,",
" Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.",

" When I do count the clock that tells the time,",
" And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;",
" When I behold the violet past prime,",
" And sable curls, all silvered o'er with white;",
" When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,",
" Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,",
" And summer's green all girded up in sheaves,",
" Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,",
" Then of thy beauty do I question make,",
" That thou among the wastes of time must go,",
" Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake",
" And die as fast as they see others grow;",
" And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence",
" Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.",

" O! that you were your self; but, love you are",
" No longer yours, than you your self here live:",
" Against this coming end you should prepare,",
" And your sweet semblance to some other give:",
" So should that beauty which you hold in lease",
" Find no determination; then you were",
" Yourself again, after yourself's decease,",
" When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.",
" Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,",
" Which husbandry in honour might uphold,",
" Against the stormy gusts of winter's day",
" And barren rage of death's eternal cold?",
" O! none but unthrifts. Dear my love, you know,",
" You had a father: let your son say so.",

" Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck;",
" And yet methinks I have astronomy,",
" But not to tell of good or evil luck,",
" Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;",
" Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,",
" Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,",
" Or say with princes if it shall go well",
" By oft predict that I in heaven find:",
" But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,",
" And constant stars in them I read such art",
" As 'Truth and beauty shall together thrive,",
" If from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert';",
" Or else of thee this I prognosticate:",
" 'Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.'",

" When I consider every thing that grows",
" Holds in perfection but a little moment,",
" That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows",
" Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;",
" When I perceive that men as plants increase,",
" Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky,",
" Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,",
" And wear their brave state out of memory;",
" Then the conceit of this inconstant stay",
" Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,",
" Where wasteful Time debateth with decay",
" To change your day of youth to sullied night,",
" And all in war with Time for love of you,",
" As he takes from you, I engraft you new.",

" But wherefore do not you a mightier way",
" Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?",
" And fortify your self in your decay",
" With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?",
" Now stand you on the top of happy hours,",
" And many maiden gardens, yet unset,",
" With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,",
" Much liker than your painted counterfeit:",
" So should the lines of life that life repair,",
" Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,",
" Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,",
" Can make you live your self in eyes of men.",
" To give away yourself, keeps yourself still,",
" And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.",

" Who will believe my verse in time to come,",
" If it were fill'd with your most high deserts?",
" Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb",
" Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts.",
" If I could write the beauty of your eyes,",
" And in fresh numbers number all your graces,",
" The age to come would say 'This poet lies;",
" Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'",
" So should my papers, yellow'd with their age,",
" Be scorn'd, like old men of less truth than tongue,",
" And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage",
" And stretched metre of an antique song:",
" But were some child of yours alive that time,",
" You should live twice,--in it, and in my rhyme.",

" Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?",
" Thou art more lovely and more temperate:",
" Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,",
" And summer's lease hath all too short a date:",
" Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,",
" And often is his gold complexion dimm'd,",
" And every fair from fair sometime declines,",
" By chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd:",
" But thy eternal summer shall not fade,",
" Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,",
" Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,",
" When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,",
" So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,",
" So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.",

" Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,",
" And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;",
" Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,",
" And burn the long-liv'd phoenix, in her blood;",
" Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,",
" And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,",
" To the wide world and all her fading sweets;",
" But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:",
" O! carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,",
" Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;",
" Him in thy course untainted do allow",
" For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.",
" Yet, do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,",
" My love shall in my verse ever live young.",

" A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,",
" Hast thou, the master mistress of my passion;",
" A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted",
" With shifting change, as is false women's fashion:",
" An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,",
" Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;",
" A man in hue all 'hues' in his controlling,",
" Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.",
" And for a woman wert thou first created;",
" Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,",
" And by addition me of thee defeated,",
" By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.",
" But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,",
" Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.",

" So is it not with me as with that Muse,",
" Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,",
" Who heaven itself for ornament doth use",
" And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,",
" Making a couplement of proud compare.",
" With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,",
" With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare,",
" That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.",
" O! let me, true in love, but truly write,",
" And then believe me, my love is as fair",
" As any mother's child, though not so bright",
" As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air:",
" Let them say more that like of hearsay well;",
" I will not praise that purpose not to sell.",

" My glass shall not persuade me I am old,",
" So long as youth and thou are of one date;",
" But when in thee time's furrows I behold,",
" Then look I death my days should expiate.",
" For all that beauty that doth cover thee,",
" Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,",
" Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:",
" How can I then be elder than thou art?",
" O! therefore love, be of thyself so wary",
" As I, not for myself, but for thee will;",
" Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary",
" As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.",
" Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,",
" Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again.",

" As an unperfect actor on the stage,",
" Who with his fear is put beside his part,",
" Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,",
" Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;",
" So I, for fear of trust, forget to say",
" The perfect ceremony of love's rite,",
" And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,",
" O'ercharg'd with burthen of mine own love's might.",
" O! let my looks be then the eloquence",
" And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,",
" Who plead for love, and look for recompense,",
" More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.",
" O! learn to read what silent love hath writ:",
" To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.",

" Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd,",
" Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;",
" My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,",
" And perspective it is best painter's art.",
" For through the painter must you see his skill,",
" To find where your true image pictur'd lies,",
" Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,",
" That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.",
" Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:",
" Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me",
" Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun",
" Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;",
" Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,",
" They draw but what they see, know not the heart.",

" Let those who are in favour with their stars",
" Of public honour and proud titles boast,",
" Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars",
" Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.",
" Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread",
" But as the marigold at the sun's eye,",
" And in themselves their pride lies buried,",
" For at a frown they in their glory die.",
" The painful warrior famoused for fight,",
" After a thousand victories once foil'd,",
" Is from the book of honour razed quite,",
" And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:",
" Then happy I, that love and am belov'd,",
" Where I may not remove nor be remov'd.",

" Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage",
" Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,",
" To thee I send this written embassage,",
" To witness duty, not to show my wit:",
" Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine",
" May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,",
" But that I hope some good conceit of thine",
" In thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it:",
" Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,",
" Points on me graciously with fair aspect,",
" And puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,",
" To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:",
" Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;",
" Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.",

" Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,",
" The dear respose for limbs with travel tir'd;",
" But then begins a journey in my head",
" To work my mind, when body's work's expired:",
" For then my thoughts--from far where I abide--",
" Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,",
" And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,",
" Looking on darkness which the blind do see:",
" Save that my soul's imaginary sight",
" Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,",
" Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,",
" Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.",
" Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,",
" For thee, and for myself, no quiet find.",

" How can I then return in happy plight,",
" That am debarre'd the benefit of rest?",
" When day's oppression is not eas'd by night,",
" But day by night and night by day oppress'd,",
" And each, though enemies to either's reign,",
" Do in consent shake hands to torture me,",
" The one by toil, the other to complain",
" How far I toil, still farther off from thee.",
" I tell the day, to please him thou art bright,",
" And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:",
" So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night,",
" When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.",
" But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,",
" And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger.",

" When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes",
" I all alone beweep my outcast state,",
" And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,",
" And look upon myself, and curse my fate,",
" Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,",
" Featur'd like him, like him with friends possess'd,",
" Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,",
" With what I most enjoy contented least;",
" Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,",
" Haply I think on thee,-- and then my state,",
" Like to the lark at break of day arising",
" From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;",
" For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings",
" That then I scorn to change my state with kings.",

" When to the sessions of sweet silent thought",
" I summon up remembrance of things past,",
" I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,",
" And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:",
" Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,",
" For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,",
" And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,",
" And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:",
" Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,",
" And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er",
" The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,",
" Which I new pay as if not paid before.",
" But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,",
" All losses are restor'd and sorrows end."]
